This is your scripts folder.

Files in this folder will be used as the scripts of your expansion.

Simply put a `c<card ID>.lua` file it's done.

For example, a card with ID `33438666` should have a file named `c33438666.lua` in this folder.
If it such file does not exist, an empty placeholder will be used.

Different from the `cards` and `meta` folders, this folder **DOES NOT** consider sub-folders.
