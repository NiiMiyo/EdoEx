This is your artworks folder.

Files in this folder will be used to generate the images of your expansion.

Simply put a `.jpg` file named after the card ID and it's done.

For example, a card with ID `33438666` should have a file named `33438666.jpg` in this folder.

Different from the `cards` and `meta` folders, this folder **DOES NOT** consider sub-folders.

The size of an artwork image is 526x526, but you can use any size and EdoEx will resize it for you. (Be careful with stretching). The size is 602x448 for pendulum monsters.
