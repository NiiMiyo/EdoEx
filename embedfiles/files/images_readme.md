This is your images folder.

Files in this folder will be used as the images of your expansion.

Simply put a `.jpg` file named after the card ID and it's done.

For example, a card with ID `33438666` should have a file named `33438666.jpg` in this folder.

Different from the `cards` and `meta` folders, this folder **DOES NOT** consider sub-folders.
