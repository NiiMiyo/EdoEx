# EdoEx

**EdoEx** is a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-Line Interface") tool to help you create and add custom cards, archetypes and counters into your [EDOPro](https://projectignis.github.io/ "The bleeding-edge automatic duel simulator").

The goal of EdoEx is to simplify expansion creation for EDOPro by using YAML files to set card properties (name, atk, def, abilities etc.) with a fast and simple to use CLI tool.
